## Format

Like other incidents, security incident training is key to ensure consistent and high level of response even in harder cases.
It can take many formats among

* written Q/A
* table-top: open discussion on simulated scenario
* role-play: organization impersonates the environment and play incident on player characters
* simulation (or firedrill): adding to role-play technical elements simulating the incidents

It's usually a recommended yearly occurrence as most advanced training requires a lot of organization.
Google presents Wheel of misfortune exercise as a common way to train new SREs [1] and based on past post-mortems making it easier to unroll it more frequently.

## Examples

Before attempting higher level scenario, be sure to cover standard incident

Higher level training

* data breach: like Target
* Network compromission: Sony, Aramco
* Vulnerability management: Heartbleed, Cloudbleed
* Stakeholders shared training: exercise involving your partners
* APT Simulation: high level consulting companies offer service to simulate Advanced Persistent Threat attack.
