PGP/GPG key management

## Usage

For confidential email, PGP/GPG is the standard way to communicate in a protected manner.
It is the standard for CERT/CSIRT community.

## Ownership

Who has private key and passphrase?
It will depend on your organization. In some case, it would be the whole team, in others, just part of it.

It's highly recommended to use a password manager with a team vault feature.

## Creation

If possible, use an offline system and/or a livecd like Tails.
Ensure that ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf is configured appropriately and RNG-tools or similar is installed to have enough entropy.

Create master key for certifying and authenticate, subkeys for signing and encryption.

Template file gen-key-script
```
%echo Generating a basic OpenPGP key
Key-Type: RSA
Key-Length: 4096
Key-Usage: cert,auth
Subkey-Type: RSA
Subkey-Length: 4096
Subkey-Usage: sign
Name-Real: My Company Security Team
Name-Email: security@mycompany.com
Expire-Date: 3y
Passphrase: Example-Passphrase-To-Be-Changed
%pubring /path/to/security.pub
%commit
%echo done
```

Create master key and signing subkey
```
$ gpg --batch --gen-key /path/to/gen-key-script
```

Add encryption subkey
```
$ gpg --edit-key security@mycompany.com
gpg> addkey
Your selection? 6 [RSA]
What keysize do you want? (3072) 4096
Key is valid for? (0) 2y
Is this correct? (y/N) y
Really create? (y/N) y
gpg> save
```
or
```
$ gpg --quick-addkey "<FINGERPRINT>" rsa4096 encr 2y
```

Check
```
$ gpg --import /path/to/security.pub
$ gpg --list-keys
$ gpg --list-secret-keys
```

Export master key and subkeys
```
$ gpg -a --export-secret-key security@mycompany.com > gpg-secret-masterkey.asc
$ gpg -a --export-secret-subkeys security@mycompany.com > gpg-secret-subkeys.asc
$ gpg --delete-secret-key 0x000MASTERKEY
$ gpg --import gpg-secret-subkeys.gpg
$ gpg -a --export security@mycompany.com > gpg-public-subkeys.asc
$ gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --send-key [your subkey ID]
$ gpg --keyserver hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net --send-key [your subkey ID]
```
Note that delete-secret-key step is selective on recent gnupg. In that case, you may not need to import secret-subkeys.

Secret master key should be archived, paper and electronic form (eventually with dedicated offline password manager or encrypted image).
Subkeys and passphrase should be stored in appropriate vault of team password manager.

Note: for individual, it's recommend to use a hardware token like yubikey or smartcard. For team, not manageable.

## Rotation

```
$ gpg --default-key old_key --sign-key new_key
$ gpg --default-key new_key --sign-key old_key
$ gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --send-key old_key new_key
```

## Revokation

It's advised to pre-generated in advance the revocation certificate for key compromise case.
If it's part of normal key rotation (superseded), generate it with reference to new key.

```
$ gpg -a --gen-revoke key > key-revocation-file
$ gpg --import key-revocation-file
$ gpg --send-key key
```


## Archive

Master private key and revocation file should be archived both in electronic format (cd/dvd/tape) and paper format (armor) in an appropriate safebox and backup location, all offline.
