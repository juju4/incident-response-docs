It's critical as incident preparation to identify appropriate resources.
A contact page and card can be useful to summarize main company contacts for incident support, security or crisis.

## Resources

Most notably

* who is the owner (business) and the corresponding technical team of a system
* where do we find the resources to solve the incident
    * internal: if the operations team and owner team don't manage to fix issue in a defined time, who we escalate? expert separate team, SRE...
    * external: do we plan for 3rd party involvment? to support legacy system where we have less internal resources, to reduce overload on them
        * for a security incident, it's uncommon for a company to have a security team mastering everything. While a certain level of incident response is necessary, smaller team should plan for external support when they are overloaded or for some advanced skills like reverse engineering or mobile forensics. Higher management can also support a 3rd party either as an extra audit, either as public relationship.
        * external involvment should be anticipated as Non-Disclosure-Agreement(NDA) and other engagement conditions need to be reviewed
* how to escalate
