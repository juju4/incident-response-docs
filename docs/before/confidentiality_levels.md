#company# has a information classification and sharing policy that details how to decide confidentiality of information.

Most common framework is the Trafic Light Protocol aka TLP

!!! note "Tools!"
    Having an information classification policy is great but if you don't offer tools to manage those physical or electronic informations, you are missing a critical piece. For example, TLP:Amber data should be encrypted at rest or in transit. TLP:RED papers should always be stored in double envelop, second one marked confidential and destroyed with approved shredder or destruction container when finished.

## Traffic Light Protocol

* TLP:RED = Not for disclosure, restricted to participants only.
* TLP:AMBER = Limited disclosure, restricted to participantsâ€™ organizations.
* TLP:GREEN = Limited disclosure, restricted to the community.
* TLP:WHITE  = Disclosure is not limited.
* TLP:EX:CHR = Chatham House Rule, the attribution (the source of information) must not be disclosed.

Usually security incidents are TLP:RED during the incidents and downgraded after in a similar manner than a company financial results are confidential until public announcement.
