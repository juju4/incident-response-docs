## Definition
Phishing is the attempt to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details, often for malicious reasons, by disguising as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing)
This document will mostly go through phishing email but it can also be through other channel like text message, social media...

## Course of Action

* Review messsage
    * recover full email with headers. Some reporting service will require msg file.
    * confirm if malicious: sender, headers, content, urls... use sandbox to investigate any attachments or url.
    * check impact: how many people impacted based on subject, from, attachment...
* For internal email, issue a mass recall
* Report to 3rd party for blocking (mail systems, browsers, proxies... see references)
* Notify users of a phishing campaign
* Notify Email provider of service abuse
* Eventually, review suspicious system case
* Takedown of the fraudulent website
    * review legal template
