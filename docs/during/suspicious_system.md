Suspicious system can lead to a server compromiser or follow a phishing.
You are at the point where you question the integrity of a system and if it should be trusted.

## Definition
Suspicious system is a wide case representing abnormal reactions of the system or possible compromise.
It includes

* Malware
* Ransomware
* Server compromise
* Data Breach

## Course of Action

* Check system information
    * owner? criticity? backup? time to rebuild?
    * network activity
    * performance activity
    * logs activity from central logging
* Collect live artifacts
    * snapshot if virtualized
    * memory
    * extra captures like tcpdump, sysdig...
    * other live artifacts: MFT, Prefetch, ...
* Collect user feedback
    * abnormal activity
    * abnormal event (call, found usb key/DVD...)
* Eventually, collect disk(offline) artifacts
* Use sandbox to investigate binaries and urls
* Cross-check indicators of compromise and behaviors with your local and shared threat intelligence
    * other systems infected? repeat.
    * attacker communication channels
    * what, when, how. how it enters, how it persists.
* Quarantine or disconnect systems
* Review if possible countermeasures to prevent infection or detect it faster
    * validate if applicable during incident or if should be in post-mortem action (signature update, firewall block, registry change...)
