Data leakage is easily transform into data theft or data breach but it is not always millions of users information. Intellectual property, company results before public or technical details of the network are also sensitive data that can leak. Lost laptop is also a data leak especially if not using full-disk encryption.
Depending on country, regulation will enforce data breach notification.
If internal staff is suspected of leakage, extra carefulness should occur with Legal and HR involvement to ensure respect of both parties rights.

## Process

* Identify impact of the leak
    * on business
    * on operations
    * on any other parties
* Identify other locations of leaked data through search engines, pastebin, forums, Torrents...
* Identify internal locations through internal search engine, Data Leak Prevention (DLP) system
* If you can identify possible owners, try to represent how data has circulated
    * what's possible: email, web, removable media, printing, photo...
    * what's confirmed through logs
    * what is not visible in any way
    * Forensics investigation of owner systems is most probably needed but require Legal and HR approval in many case. Remember that in some countries (ex: Europe), you can't search private/personal folders without user consent or a reasonable suspicion (usually through automated scanner)
* If you can't identify internal owners
    * Third parties involved? Partners, visitors...
* Whose data is impacted?
    * Customers, current, old ones
    * Employees, current, old ones
    * Sales prospect
    * Partners
    * Others
* Communicate appropriately depending on the data leak.
    * internally
    * externally: customers, partners, regulators, law enforcement
* Regularly evaluate impact of the incident and if it should be treated as a crisis

* [The "we suffered a security incident & your data is at risk" letters are pretty standard. New (to me, at least) is the "[redacted] confirmed from the intruder that any data that was accessed and copied has been destroyed." But, don't worry, "[redacted2] reports that it is actively monitoring via 3rd party experts and has found no trace of the data being available." The letter goes on to note how the "intruder was detected & expelled from the system." So: anonymous 3rd party has it totally under control, and we're taking the intruder at their word.](https://twitter.com/jckichen/status/1297307412299358208)
